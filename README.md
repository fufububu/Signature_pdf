# Signature pdf
Program to insert markers on signature spines when binding books.  
During automatic book stiching sometimes some pages go out of sequence and sognatures go wrong,  
if not rapidly detected you will end with books to dismantle and correct or even worse to throw away if already binded.  
I wrote this program to add a number to each signature in order rapidly check the correctness of stiching  
only looking at the book spine. Looking at book spine should see something like:     
<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
